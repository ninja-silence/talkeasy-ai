# Talkeasy — Brand Context for Landing Page Update

## What changed
The product formerly known as **VoiceLink** has been renamed to **Talkeasy**. This doc gives you everything needed to update the landing page copy, styling, and assets to reflect the new brand.

Find/replace across the codebase: `VoiceLink` → `Talkeasy` (check casing variants: `voicelink`, `VOICELINK`, `voice-link`, `voice_link` in slugs, env vars, meta tags, package names, etc.)

## Product summary

Talkeasy is a voice-first, open-source AI assistant for elderly and digitally-excluded users. It helps people navigate hand-held devices without needing written-English literacy or a reliable internet connection. Berlin-based.

**One-line pitch:** Talkeasy helps anyone — regardless of age, literacy, or tech experience — use their phone with just their voice.

**Origin story (useful for hero copy):** Built for people like "she just wants to call her daughter" — users who are capable and independent but locked out of modern devices by interface complexity, not ability.

## Mission / Vision / Values

**Vision:** A world where senior citizens and the digitally illiterate have ease of navigation to the full capabilities of hand-held devices.

**Mission:**
- Help users navigate technology without assuming written English literacy (language inclusion)
- Help users navigate technology without needing an internet connection (reliable, offline-first)

**Core values:**
- **Inclusion** — accessible regardless of language, literacy, or digital experience
- **Empowerment** — gives users agency over their own digital lives
- **Simplicity** — reduces complexity, never adds it
- **Privacy** — sensitive data stays on-device
- **Open Source** — built in public, contributes back to the community

**Guiding product principles:**
- Does not add new functionality to existing device features
- Makes it easier to navigate modern technology through existing accessibility tools, empowered by AI

**Target users:** Senior citizens (in care centers, living alone, or with family), digitally illiterate persons.
**Secondary stakeholders:** Care providers, family members.

## Brand voice & tone
Helpful, warm, friendly, human. Not techy, not corporate, not sci-fi. Copy should read like a kind person explaining something patiently — never jargon-heavy, never condescending. Short sentences. Plain words. Speak to the user's independence and dignity, not their limitations.

## Visual identity

**Logo:** Speech bubble + sound-wave icon, paired with the "Talkeasy" wordmark.

**Canva Brand Kit:** "talkeasy" (kit id `kAHOIPvPsLY`) — colors, fonts, and logo are stored there as the source of truth.

### Color palette
| Role | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Primary — Coral | `#E2634B` | Primary buttons, key accents, links |
| Secondary — Orange | `#F2965C` | Secondary accents, hover states, icons |
| Accent — Peach | `#F8DBAB` | Subtle highlights, backgrounds for callouts |
| Neutral — Warm Cream | `#F5E6D0` | Page background |
| Text — Slate Teal | `#4E6B69` | Body text, headings, wordmark color |

Avoid harsh neon, cold blues, or high-contrast "tech" palettes — the whole point is to feel warm and approachable, especially to an older, less tech-confident audience.

### Typography
- **Headings / wordmark style:** Poppins (bold) — rounded, friendly, highly legible
- **Body copy:** Nunito — rounded terminals to match the friendly tone
- Font sizes should skew larger than typical SaaS landing pages — this audience benefits from higher legibility (consider a baseline body size of 18–20px instead of 16px)

### Design principles for the page
- Clean, uncluttered layouts — generous whitespace, no visual noise
- Rounded corners on UI elements (buttons, cards, images) to match the soft/friendly logo language
- High color contrast for text readability (important for older users / accessibility)
- No sharp/angular or "sci-fi AI" visual motifs — avoid circuit-board patterns, glowing neon gradients, robot iconography
- Speech-bubble and sound-wave motifs can be reused as supporting illustration elements throughout the page

## Suggested landing page copy anchors
(For Claude Code to use as a starting point — not final copy)

- **Hero headline direction:** something around ease + connection, e.g. "Technology that finally talks your language" or "Just talk. Talkeasy does the rest."
- **Subhead:** should mention voice-first, no internet required, no reading required
- **Sections to include:** Mission/why we exist, how it works (voice-first demo), privacy/on-device promise, open-source note, testimonials/impact goal (KPI: happy user testimonials on social media), call to action (early access / donate / accelerator-facing CTA depending on current page goal)

## Accessibility note
This is a product *for* accessibility — the landing page itself should model that: large tap targets, high contrast text, readable font sizes, alt text on all images, and avoid relying on color alone to convey meaning.
